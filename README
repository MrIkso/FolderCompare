Easy to use folder and file (diff) comparison tool.

Requires Android: Android 2.1 and up

Use it to find changes between two folders and
to find differences between two different versions of a file.
It supports:
* A colour-coded comparison makes it easy to pinpoint at a glance similarities and differences between files
* Filter settings (file size, file modification date, regular expressions, etc.)
* Comparison settings
* html report generation for folder comparison results
* html report generation for file comparison results
Whereas process of folder comparison may be slow depending on file size and file count,
you will see intermediate results of comparison and it is also possible to stop comparison
process in any time.
You may compare files which have differences. A colour-coded comparison makes it
easy to pinpoint at a glance similarities and differences between files.
